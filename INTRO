deploy the application to EKS using ARGOCD(where it takes latest image from ECR to EKS)

The whole thing written in jenkins delarative pipeline in to different stages 
1.clone the code
2.Build the code and generated artifacts
3. code quality(sonar qube)

and we are following agile methodology
where we follow sprints , 2 weeks a sprint 
in that sprint planning , userstories were assingned and we need close them with in that sprint 
using a JIRA ticketing tool
